```javascript
// pages/index.js
import React from 'react';
export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
    </div>
  );
}
```
This corrected code properly imports React and exports a valid React component as the default export. This resolves the issue and ensures that the page renders correctly.
